# Installation
**See Install Doc**
[Install Document](https://github.com/InsanityLabs/AIVTuber/blob/main/INSTALL.md)

## VTube Studio API
I'm using the [VTS Desktop Audio Plugin by Lua Lucky](https://lualucky.itch.io/vts-desktop-audio-plugin) to capture the sound and send it as Parameters so that the sides of the character can move.

[Plugins list](https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio)
